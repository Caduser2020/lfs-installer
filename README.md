# lfs-installer
Installs a copy of Linux from Scratch onto a Red Hat based distribution of Linux.

## Getting Started

Download the 'install.sh' & 'wget-list.txt' files onto the Downloads folder of the machine that you are installing Linux from scratch on. Then, run the command below to start the install.
```
bash install.sh
```

### Prerequisites

This script is validated for Red Hat based distributions, such as:
* CentOS
* Fedora
* RHEL

### Validated Host Operating Systems
* CentOS 7
* Fedora 30

## Troubleshooting
Why are some of the urls not working? Some of the URLs change with LFS versions or the site administrators of the download location remove older versions when new ones are released, especially File (5.36). In that case, open an issue to let me know and check for an updated url at [LFS Downloads](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/download.html#ftp).
