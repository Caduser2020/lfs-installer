# lfs-installer
Installs a copy of Linux from Scratch onto a CentOS or similar machine.

## Getting Started

Download the 'install.sh' & 'wget-list.txt' files onto the Downloads folder of the machine that you are installing Linux from scratch on. Then, run the command below to start the install.
```
bash install.sh
```

### Prerequisites

This script is validated for Red Hat based distros, such as:
* [x] CentOS
* [ ] Fedora
* [x] RHEL

## Troubleshooting
Why are some of the urls not working? Some of the urls change with LFS versions or the site administrators of the download
location remove older versions when new ones are released, espcially File (5.36). In that case, open an issue to let me know and check for an updated url at [LFS Downloads](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/download.html#ftp).
